# mantine-corporate

Corporational variant of theme, based on @aokiapp/rjsf-mantine-theme

## Demo

We have a playgroud where you can see the theme in action:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
cd packages/playground
npm run start
```

## Installation

replace module name from `@aokiapp/rjsf-mantine-theme` to `@aokiapp/mantine-theme-corporate`

If you use `FileWidget` you need to install `@mantine/dropzone` as well, and make sure to `import '@mantine/dropzone/styles.css';` in your project.
